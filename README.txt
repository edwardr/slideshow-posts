3. Visit the Options panel to set up the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I use a custom template? =

By default, Slideshow Posts uses your single.php template -- the same template that's generally used for blog posts. You can make a custom template by copying the single.php template into a new file named "single-cw-slideshow.php" -- this will then be used instead of single.php and you can make your template customizations. Do not remove the loop or the slideshow content will not display.
